Bought an IP camera made by HLong_asia on Aliexpress. Against the description of the camera it does say Windows 7 for the supported OS. However, there is little information on how to connect to or use these cameras using Linux so I want to collect any information here on this repository. There is Windoze software available for their cameras on their websites but I wanted some examples how to use their cameras and all their features. The Linux SDK does not really address the issue. This repository will be examples of various small programs written to illustrate how to make use of their cameras.

The camera I have uses this board based on the 1/2.8" Sony Exmor IMX291 image sensor low light 0.001 LUX
